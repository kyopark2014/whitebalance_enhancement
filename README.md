# whitebalance_enhancement
It has two projects: white balance measurement program and white balance enhancement algorithm for TV.


## white balance measurement program using Visual C++

White balance is one of key features to define the quality of display panel. The developed software can test and validate the white balance in real-time environment.


## white balance enhancement algorithm for PDP TV

The proposed algorithm enhances the white balance in real time for PDP display and then embedded in LG PDP TV to enhance the quality of display
